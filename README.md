This assignment shows how a simple requisition system for purchasing, which allows the staff member to input details like name, ID, date, price, and make unique ID g for those who input the credentials, and there is  also a calculator, which calculates the total at the end, and displays whether the request is approved or pending. there are four functions staff_info(), requisitions_total(), requisition_approval(), and display_requisitions()


---------------------------------------------------------------------------function details----------------------------------------------------------


**In staff_info(), staff member input their data, like name, ID, date, and a requisition increments by 1 if details are entered. There is a while loop so that if another customer needs to add, then they can type yes, if not, then break, say no.


**requisitions_total().   After entering all the details, the system will prompt you to enter the item name, followed by the price. If the customer has more than one item, only the system will sum the cost of one cylinder. If there are different or multiple options, then it will sum all of them.


**requisition_approval(). This function tells us the status, like approved or pending. if the total price is above 500, it will show pending if it is less than, approved will print the total and status. String and slicing methods are used in this function, and an if statement is also used.


**display_requisitions(). This function collects all the data from the above functions and reports them as a summary.
There are some software design principles applied, like K.I.S.S, Single Responsibility, Separation of Concerns, Clean Code, Open/Closed, Single Responsibility, and D.R.Y


----------------------------------------------------------------Principle Implementation-----------------------------------------------------------------


1.K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Simple loops and conditions for clarity

2.D.R.Y (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself): Reused variables for total calculation

3.Single Responsibility: Each function performs one specific task

4.Separation of Concerns: Input, calculation, and display are handled separately

5.Open/Closed Principle: Approval rules can be easily extended


--------------------------------------------------------------------All Principles--------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. K.I.S.S:- In this principle, codes are simple to understand and straightforward. Through this principle, we can stop avoiding unnecessary complexity. How much does the simple code help to understand?
   there are 2 function in which K.I.S.S is implement. line 23 of caltex, papaura, where the program simply manages  the loop, which avoid other works for example ,
   in these codes :-
  #  choice = input("Do you want to add another staff? (yes/no): ").lower()
  
        if choice == "yes"  or choice == "no":           #K.I.S.S is used here in simple statement yes/no    
                            
                            # break helps to stop the loop from repeatind if staff says no
                            break
   

In requisition_total()from 64  lines,  i had simply applied a true statement to keep it simple and break the loop by typing done.

 if item.lower() == "done":

            # stop the loop when type done

            break                
        
        The break statement is used there to break the 
        while loop even if it is true """
This is simple because if the customer types done they exit the loops.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. D.R.Y :- To avoide the repeating logic and make it into a single position. this will help when a person need to make a change, if D.R.Y principle is applied they would only need to change it from one place only.
